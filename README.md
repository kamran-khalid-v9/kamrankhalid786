## 👋 Hey there, I’m **Kamran Khalid**

I’m a **Senior Backend Developer** with 10+ years of experience building **clean, scalable, and maintainable systems**. I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant backend solutions using technologies like **PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter)**, **Node.js**, and modern JavaScript. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

I’ve worked on real-world systems — from **payment flows and CRM onboarding frameworks** to **microservices architectures** and **APIs that power products with impact**. What drives me most is crafting software that not only works, but works *well* — reliably and with clarity. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

I also speak and write about software design and architecture — including a talk on *choosing the right tech stack for products* delivered at GDG Manchester — and regularly publish technical posts to help developers write better backend code. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
