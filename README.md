## 👋 Hi, I’m Kamran Khalid

I am a **Senior Backend Developer** with over a decade of experience building and scaling production systems. My expertise lies in **PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter)** and **Node.js**, with a strong focus on API design, microservices architecture, and long-term code maintainability.

Throughout my career, I’ve specialised in solving complex business logic problems — particularly in **payment automation**, **CRM workflows**, and **document management systems**. I believe in pragmatic engineering: writing code that is high-performing, readable, and easy for teams to evolve over time.

### 🚀 What I’m building right now
I believe technical writing is most valuable when accompanied by working code. I’m currently translating my **Medium articles** into **practical, runnable implementations**. These examples — along with other projects such as the **GT project** — are available in the pinned repositories below. Each project is designed to demonstrate clean architecture and real-world application.
